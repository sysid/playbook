# üõ†Ô∏è Playbook

> Playbooks are guardrails for humans

**Playbook** encodes manual workflows into semi-automated processes which provide assistance, checkpoint and tools for a human operator.

It reduces pressure and heat in critical situations by guiding along a proven and tested course of action.

It supports manual approvals, shell commands, and Python functions as workflow steps ‚Äî making it ideal for operations automation and orchestrated runbooks.

# Or install plugins separately as needed
pip install playbook
pip install playbook-aws playbook-k8s
```

Run with:

```bash
playbook --help
```


## üìù Runbook Format (TOML)

Playbook workflows are defined as TOML files with the following structure:

### Runbook Metadata

```toml
[runbook]
title       = "Example Workflow"
description = """
Comprehensive workflow demonstrating DAG execution with multiple node types.
This runbook showcases manual approvals, automated commands, and plugin integration
to provide a complete operational automation solution.
"""
version     = "0.1.0"
author      = "tw"
created_at  = "2025-05-03T12:00:00Z"
```

### Node Definition

Each node is a separate TOML table. You define:

- `type`: One of `"Manual"`, `"Command"`, `"Function"`
- `depends_on`: List of upstream node IDs (empty for roots)
- `name`: (Optional) Display name
- `description`: (Optional) Shown in CLI
- Additional fields depend on node type.

#### Manual Node

```toml
[approve]
type         = "Manual"
prompt_after = "Proceed with deployment?"
description  = """
Critical manual approval checkpoint for production deployment.
This step ensures proper authorization and readiness assessment
before proceeding with changes that affect live systems.
"""
depends_on   = ["setup"]
skip         = false
critical     = true
```

#### Command Node

```toml
[build]
type         = "Command"
command_name = "make build"
description  = """
Build application artifacts with all dependencies and optimizations.
This step compiles source code, resolves dependencies, and creates
deployable packages ready for testing and deployment.
"""
depends_on   = ["setup"]
timeout      = 300
```

#### Function Node

Function nodes use plugin-based execution:

```toml
[slack_notify]
type = "Function"
plugin = "slack"                    # Plugin name
function = "send_message"           # Function within plugin
function_params = {
    channel = "#ops",
    message = "Deployment complete!"
}
plugin_config = {
    webhook_url = "${SLACK_WEBHOOK}",
    timeout = 30
}
description = "Notify team via Slack"
depends_on = ["build", "tests"]
```

**Built-in Python functions:**
```toml
[notify_completion]
type = "Function"
plugin = "python"
function = "notify"
function_params = { message = "Deployment complete!" }
description = "Send notification"
depends_on = ["build", "tests"]
```

### Conditional Dependencies and Branching

Playbook supports sophisticated conditional logic for complex workflow patterns:

#### Shorthand Conditional Dependencies
```toml
[deploy_success]
type = "Command"
command_name = "echo 'Deployment successful'"
depends_on = ["deploy:success"]  # Only run if deploy succeeded

[rollback_deployment]
type = "Command"
command_name = "rollback.sh"
depends_on = ["deploy:failure"]  # Only run if deploy failed

[cleanup]
type = "Command"
command_name = "cleanup.sh"
depends_on = ["deploy:success", "rollback:success"]  # Run after either succeeds
```

#### Advanced Conditional Logic with Jinja2
```toml
[variables]
ENVIRONMENT = { required = true, choices = ["dev", "staging", "prod"] }
SKIP_TESTS = { default = false, type = "bool" }

[security_scan]
type = "Command"
command_name = "security-scan --strict"
depends_on = ["build"]
when = "{{ ENVIRONMENT == 'prod' }}"  # Only run for production

[run_tests]
type = "Command"
command_name = "npm test"
depends_on = ["build"]
when = "{{ not SKIP_TESTS and ENVIRONMENT in ['staging', 'prod'] }}"

[deploy]
type = "Command"
command_name = "deploy.sh {{ENVIRONMENT}}"
depends_on = ["build"]
when = "{{ (SKIP_TESTS or has_succeeded('run_tests')) and (ENVIRONMENT != 'prod' or has_succeeded('security_scan')) }}"
```

### Variables

Make workflows dynamic with variable support. Define variables in a `[variables]` section:

```toml
[variables]
APP_NAME = { default = "myapp", description = "Application name" }
ENVIRONMENT = { required = true, choices = ["dev", "staging", "prod"] }
VERSION = { default = "latest", description = "Version to deploy" }
TIMEOUT = { default = 300, type = "int", min = 60, max = 3600 }

[runbook]
title = "Deploy {{APP_NAME}} to {{ENVIRONMENT}}"
description = "Deploy {{APP_NAME}} version {{VERSION}}"
# ... rest of runbook metadata

[deploy]
type = "Command"
command_name = "kubectl apply -f {{APP_NAME}}-{{ENVIRONMENT}}.yaml"
description = "Deploy {{APP_NAME}} version {{VERSION}} to {{ENVIRONMENT}}"
timeout = "{{TIMEOUT}}"
critical = "{% if ENVIRONMENT == 'prod' %}true{% else %}false{% endif %}"
depends_on = []
```

#### Variable Sources (Priority Order)
1. **CLI arguments**: `--var ENVIRONMENT=prod --var VERSION=1.2.3`
2. **Variable files**: `--vars-file production.vars.toml`
3. **Environment variables**: `--vars-env PLAYBOOK_VAR_` (loads PLAYBOOK_VAR_*)
4. **Interactive prompts**: Automatic prompts for missing required variables
5. **Defaults**: From variable definitions in workflow file

#### Interactive Variable Prompts
Playbook automatically prompts for missing required variables during execution:
```bash
# Interactive mode (default) - prompts for missing variables
playbook run deploy.playbook.toml --var ENVIRONMENT=prod
# Will prompt: "Enter value for VERSION (Version to deploy) [latest]: "

# Non-interactive mode - fails if required variables are missing
playbook run deploy.playbook.toml --var ENVIRONMENT=prod --no-interactive-vars
```

#### Jinja2 Features
- **Simple substitution**: `{{VAR_NAME}}`
- **Defaults**: `{{VAR_NAME|default('fallback')}}`
- **Filters**: `{{APP_NAME|upper}}`, `{{SERVICES|join(', ')}}`
- **Conditionals**: `{% if ENVIRONMENT == 'prod' %}critical{% endif %}`
- **Loops**: `{% for service in SERVICES %}deploy {{service}} && {% endfor %}`

#### Automatic Type Conversion
Playbook automatically converts template variables to the expected parameter types:

```toml
[variables]
TIMEOUT = { default = 300, type = "int" }
ENABLED = { default = true, type = "bool" }

[sleep_step]
type = "Function"
plugin = "python"
function = "sleep"
function_params = { seconds = "{{TIMEOUT}}" }  # String "300" ‚Üí int 300

[notification]
type = "Function"
plugin = "example"
function = "send_alert"
function_params = {
    message = "Alert for {{APP_NAME}}",  # Stays as string
    urgent = "{{ENABLED}}"               # String "true" ‚Üí bool true
}
```

**Supported conversions:**
- `int`: `"42"` ‚Üí `42`
- `float`: `"3.14"` ‚Üí `3.14`
- `bool`: `"true"/"false"`, `"1"/"0"`, `"yes"/"no"` ‚Üí `true`/`false`
- `list`: `'["a","b"]'` ‚Üí `["a", "b"]` (JSON parsing)
- `dict`: `'{"key":"value"}'` ‚Üí `{"key": "value"}` (JSON parsing)

## üîå Plugin System

Playbook features a powerful plugin system that allows external packages to extend functionality through a standardized interface.

### Using Plugins

#### Plugin Installation
```bash
# Install plugins from PyPI
pip install playbook-slack playbook-aws playbook-http

# List available plugins
playbook info --plugins
```

#### Plugin Discovery
Plugins are automatically discovered through Python entry points. Once installed, they're immediately available in workflows without configuration.

#### Plugin Configuration

Plugins support both global and per-node configuration:

```toml
# Global plugin configuration (applies to all uses)
[runbook.plugin_config.slack]
default_webhook = "${SLACK_WEBHOOK}"
timeout = 30

# Per-node plugin configuration (overrides global)
[notify_success]
type = "Function"
plugin = "slack"
function = "send_message"
function_params = { channel = "#ops", message = "Success!" }
plugin_config = { webhook_url = "${SUCCESS_WEBHOOK}" }  # Node-specific override
```

### Plugin Development

For an example plugin implementation, see the built-in Python plugin in `playbook/plugins/python_plugin.py` or
the full-blown example in `playbook-slack-plugin`.

#### When to Create a Plugin

Create a separate plugin when you need:
- **External service integrations** (APIs, databases, cloud services)
- **Specialized data processing** or transformations
- **Domain-specific functionality** unique to your use case

The built-in Python plugin provides basic utilities (`notify`, `sleep`, `throw`) as demonstrations. 

#### Creating a Plugin

External developers can create plugins by implementing the `Plugin` interface:

```python
# my_plugin/plugin.py
from playbook.domain.plugins import Plugin, PluginMetadata, FunctionSignature, ParameterDef

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    def get_metadata(self) -> PluginMetadata:
        return PluginMetadata(
            name="my-plugin",
            version="1.0.0",
            author="Your Name",
            description="Custom functionality for Playbook",
            functions={
                "my_function": FunctionSignature(
                    name="my_function",
                    description="Does something useful",
                    parameters={
                        "input": ParameterDef(
                            type="str",
                            required=True,
                            description="Input parameter"
                        )
                    }
                )
            }
        )

    def initialize(self, config):
        self.config = config

    def execute(self, function_name, params):
        if function_name == "my_function":
            return f"Processed: {params['input']}"

    def cleanup(self):
        pass
```

#### Plugin Registration

Register your plugin via setuptools entry points in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."playbook.plugins"]
my-plugin = "my_plugin.plugin:MyPlugin"
```

#### Plugin Distribution

```bash
# Package and distribute
pip install build
python -m build
twine upload dist/*

# Install and use
pip install my-plugin
```

### Details and Specification
More info: [DAG.md](doc/DAG.md)

## ‚ö° Retry and Error Handling

Playbook provides robust error handling and retry capabilities for resilient workflow execution:

### Interactive Retry Functionality
When a node fails during execution, Playbook offers interactive choices:
- **Retry (r)**: Attempt the failed node again (tracks attempt number)
- **Skip (s)**: Skip the failed node and continue (only for non-critical nodes)
- **Abort (a)**: Stop the entire workflow execution

```bash
# Configure maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
playbook run workflow.playbook.toml --max-retries 5

# Resume failed workflows from specific nodes
playbook resume workflow.playbook.toml <run_id> --max-retries 3
```

### Attempt Tracking
- Each retry gets a new attempt number with full state persistence
- Execution history is maintained for debugging and analysis
- Critical nodes cannot be skipped, only retried or aborted
- Progress tracking correctly handles retry loops

### Node Criticality
```toml
[critical_deployment]
type = "Command"
command_name = "deploy-production.sh"
critical = true  # Cannot be skipped if it fails
depends_on = ["tests"]

[optional_notification]
type = "Function"
plugin = "slack"
function = "send_message"
critical = false  # Can be skipped if it fails
depends_on = ["critical_deployment"]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

Playbook features a flexible configuration system with environment-based settings:

### Configuration Discovery
Playbook searches for configuration files in this order:
1. **Local**: `./playbook.toml` (project-specific)
2. **User**: `~/.config/playbook/config.toml` (user-specific)
3. **System**: `/etc/playbook/config.toml` (system-wide)

### Environment-Based Configuration
```bash
# Set environment for configuration selection
export PLAYBOOK_ENV=production  # development, testing, production

# Direct configuration file override
export PLAYBOOK_CONFIG=/path/to/custom.toml
```

### Configuration Sections
```toml
[database]
path = "~/.config/playbook/run.db"
timeout = 30
backup_enabled = true
backup_count = 5

[execution]
default_timeout = 300
max_retries = 3
interactive_timeout = 1800
parallel_execution = false

[logging]
level = "INFO"
file_path = ""  # Empty = console only
max_size_mb = 10
backup_count = 3

[ui]
progress_style = "bar"
color_theme = "auto"  # auto, light, dark, none
show_timestamps = true
compact_output = false
```

### Environment Variable Overrides
```bash
# Override specific configuration values
export PLAYBOOK_DB_PATH="/custom/path/run.db"
export PLAYBOOK_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
export PLAYBOOK_MAX_RETRIES=5
```

### Configuration Management Commands
```bash
# Show current configuration
playbook config --show

# Initialize environment-specific configuration
playbook config --init production

# Validate configuration
playbook config --validate

# Generate configuration template
playbook config --template config-template.toml
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª CLI Usage

## üìÇ State and Storage

- SQLite DB at `~/.config/playbook/run.db` by default
- Run and node execution state is persisted
- Allows resuming failed runs or inspecting previous ones


## üß© Extending and Plugin Ecosystem

### Creating Plugins

**Plugin-Only Architecture**: Playbook uses a strict plugin-only architecture. All custom functionality must be implemented as plugins that adhere to the plugin interface. There is no mechanism to execute arbitrary Python code dynamically.

The recommended way to extend Playbook functionality is through plugins:

1. **Create a plugin package**: Implement the `Plugin` interface
2. **Register via entry points**: Use `playbook.plugins` entry point group
3. **Distribute**: Publish to PyPI or install locally
4. **Use in workflows**: Reference by plugin name in TOML files

### Plugin Development Best Practices

- **Parameter validation**: Define comprehensive `ParameterDef` schemas
- **Error handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
- **Documentation**: Include examples and detailed function descriptions
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all plugin functions
- **Security**: Validate all inputs and handle secrets properly

### Core System Extension

For core system modifications:
- **Infrastructure adapters**: New persistence/visualization backends
- **Domain extensions**: New node types or workflow features
- **Service layer**: New execution strategies or orchestration logic
- **Architecture**: Follow hexagonal architecture boundaries

### Plugin Naming Conventions

- **Package names**: `playbook-{service}` (e.g., `playbook-slack`)
- **Entry point names**: Short, descriptive (e.g., `slack`, `aws`, `http`)
- **Function names**: Action-oriented (e.g., `send_message`, `create_instance`)

### Contributing

- Plugin contributions welcome via separate packages
- Core system contributions via pull requests
- Documentation improvements always appreciated
