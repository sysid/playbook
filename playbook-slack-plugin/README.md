## Installation

### From PyPI (when published)

```bash
pip install playbook-slack
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/playbook-slack-plugin
cd playbook-slack-plugin
pip install -e .
```

### With UV (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/playbook-slack-plugin
cd playbook-slack-plugin
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Slack Integration

#### Option A: Slack Webhook (for messages only)
1. Go to your Slack workspace settings
2. Create a new Incoming Webhook
3. Copy the webhook URL

#### Option B: Slack Bot Token (for full functionality)
1. Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Add the following OAuth scopes:
   - `chat:write`
   - `files:write`
   - `channels:manage`
   - `channels:read`
3. Install the app to your workspace
4. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token

### 2. Configure the Plugin

Create a runbook with plugin configuration:

```toml
[variables]
SLACK_WEBHOOK = { default = "${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}", description = "Slack webhook URL" }

# Global plugin configuration
[runbook.plugin_config.slack]
webhook_url = "{{SLACK_WEBHOOK}}"
default_channel = "#general"
timeout = 30

[runbook]
title = "Slack Notification Example"
description = "Send notifications to Slack"
version = "1.0.0"
author = "DevOps Team"
created_at = "2025-01-20T12:00:00Z"

[notify]
type = "Function"
plugin = "slack"
function = "send_message"
function_params = {
    text = "Hello from Playbook!",
    channel = "#general",
    urgency = "normal"
}
description = "Send a test notification"
depends_on = []
```

### 3. Run the Workflow

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="your-webhook-url-here"
playbook run your-workflow.playbook.toml
```

## Configuration

The plugin supports both global and per-node configuration:

### Global Configuration

```toml
[runbook.plugin_config.slack]
webhook_url = "${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}"          # For send_message
bot_token = "${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}"              # For send_file, create_channel
default_channel = "#general"                  # Default channel for messages
timeout = 30                                  # Request timeout in seconds
```

### Per-Node Configuration

```toml
[critical_alert]
type = "Function"
plugin = "slack"
function = "send_message"
function_params = { text = "Critical system alert!" }
plugin_config = {
    webhook_url = "${CRITICAL_ALERT_WEBHOOK}",  # Override global webhook
    default_channel = "#alerts"                 # Override default channel
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-your-bot-token"

function = "create_channel"
function_params = {
    name = "{{PROJECT_NAME|lower}}-{{ENVIRONMENT}}",
    purpose = "Deployment logs for {{PROJECT_NAME}} {{ENVIRONMENT}}",
    topic = "Current deployment status"
}
depends_on = ["notify_start"]

# Step 3: Run deployment (example command)

    channel = "#deployments",
    urgency = "high"
}
depends_on = ["upload_logs"]
```

### Error Handling with Urgency Levels

```toml
# Critical alert example
[critical_alert]
type = "Function"
plugin = "slack"
function = "send_message"
function_params = {
    text = "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Database connection failed in {{ENVIRONMENT}}",

function = "send_message"
function_params = {
    text = "High CPU usage detected on {{SERVER_NAME}}",
    channel = "#monitoring",

}

# Low priority information
[info_message]
type = "Function"

```

## Testing with Real Slack

To test with real Slack integration:

1. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="your-webhook-url"
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
```

2. Run example workflows:
```bash
make example-basic      # Basic notification
make example-advanced   # Advanced workflow with file upload and channel creation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"webhook_url is required" error**: Make sure you have either `webhook_url` or `bot_token` configured
2. **"bot_token is required" error**: File upload and channel creation require a bot token, not just a webhook
3. **"Channel already exists" error**: The channel name is already taken, use a different name
4. **"Invalid channel name" error**: Channel names must be lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores only

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to see detailed plugin operation:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('playbook_slack').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Slack API Permissions

Make sure your Slack bot has the required permissions:
- `chat:write` - Send messages
- `files:write` - Upload files
- `channels:manage` - Create channels
- `channels:read` - Read channel information
